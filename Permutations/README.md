# Permutations.
    Permutation refers to the arrangement of elements in a specific order or sequence. It represents a rearrangement of the elements of a set, where the order of the elements matters.

    In mathematics and computer science, permutations are often used to solve problems related to arranging or selecting elements in a particular order. They are frequently utilized in algorithms, combinatorics, cryptography, and various other fields. Permutations are valuable for tasks such as generating all possible combinations, solving puzzles, or analyzing different outcomes in probability theory.

    In summary, permutations are a fundamental concept that involves rearranging elements in a specific order, finding all possible arrangements, and solving problems that involve arranging or selecting elements.

# Python Version
    Python 3.11.2

# Objectiv
    The objective of this code is that when it is executed, depending on how wide the parameters for the permutation are, it consumes all the RAM memory and with this we can identify when a code consumes all the memory in our machine.
